                    <h3>Puffer Fish</h3>
                    <p>
                        Puffer fish are native to the waters surounding Japan, China,
                        Phillipines, and Mexico. The puffer fish’s skin, muscle tissue, 
                        liver, and gonads all contain a toxin known as tetrodoxin. If you 
                        are so unfortunate as to consume this toxin, you will experience a 
                        tingling sensation, burning in your mouth, nausea, headache, and 
                        speech and coordination problems. If you ingest too much, you will 
                        experience convulsions, paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and ultimately death.

                    <h3>Poison Dart Frog</h3>
                    <p>
                        The poison dart frog is small and brightly patterned. 
                        Typically it lives in South and Central America or Hawaii. 
                        The poison the dart frog’s glands contain is called batrachotoxin. 
                        This toxin blocks nerve signals to muscles, causing paralysis and death.

                    <h3>Inland Taipan</h3>
                    <p>
                            Many snakes are poisonous, but the inland taipan is among 
                            the most deadly on the planet. The inland taipan lives in 
                            Australia and has a neurotoxin in its venom which is capable 
                            of killing a person within 45 minutes. Thankfully, the inland 
                            taipan’s bite can readily be treated. Amazingly enough, there 
                            are no reported deaths caused by this snake.

                    <h3>Brazilian Wandering Spider</h3>
                    <p>
                            This spider is also known as a “banana spider.” It is regularly 
                            confused with the golden silk orb-weaver, because that species 
                            of spider has bright yellow coloration and is also often 
                            colloquially (and incorrectly) referred to as a “banana spider.” 
                            Golden orb spiders are relatively harmless, despite their 
                            frightening appearance. Brazilian wandering spiders on the 
                            other hand are decidedly not. They were rated as the most venomous 
                            animal on the planet by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2007. 
                            The high dosage of serotonin in the Brazilian wandering spider’s 
                            venom is extremely painful. The neurotoxins present can cause 
                            paralysis and death.

                    <h3>Stone Fish</h3>
                    <p>
                            Divers should be wary of this venomous fish, which disguises 
                            itself with its camouflaged appearance and can easily blend in 
                            with rocks on the seabed. Usually the stonefish is found lurking 
                            above the Tropic of Capricorn. The spines on the fish’s back 
                            carry a toxin that can cause swelling, necrosis of tissue, paralysis, 
                            shock, and ultimately death. While the toxin is treatable, treatment 
                            must take place immediately. Being as that is generally challenging 
                            or impossible when one takes in a toxin while swimming along the ocean 
                            floor, the stonefish is quite deadly. If possible, the victim should 
                            immerse the wound site in hot water while traveling to the nearest 
                            hospital.

                    <h3>Death Stalker Scorpion</h3>
                    <p>
                            This scorpion is pale yellow in color and translucent in appearance 
                            and usually found in the Middle East and North Africa. While it may 
                            look delicate and ephemeral, the threat posed by this scorpion is 
                            quite substantial. Venom from a death stalker scorpion can cause a 
                            good deal of pain as well as respiratory failure. Those with heart 
                            problems or allergies are particularly likely to die from a sting.

                    <h3>Blue-Ringed Octopus</h3>
                    <p>
                            This tiny octopus is about the size of a golf ball, and could easily 
                            sit in the palm of your hand. Nonetheless, you definitely wouldn’t 
                            want it to, since it is quite nearly the most venomous animal in 
                            the sea. Blue-ringed octopi make their homes around Australia, 
                            Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua, New Guinea. The venom 
                            from this animal can cause blindness, nausea, paralysis and 
                            respiratory failure, as well as death.

                    <h3>Marbled Cone Snail</h3>
                    <p>
                            This cone-shaped snail shell contains a creature which can deliver 
                            one seriously dangerous venom. Mild symptoms may include pain, 
                            inflammation, numbness, and tingling. If you get a high dose of 
                            venom, you will experience vision loss, respiratory failure, and 
                            muscle paralysis—and eventually death. There is no anti-venom 
                            available, so there is no way to treat the victim. Because of this, 
                            the marbled cone snail as rated as one of the most dangerous animals 
                            in the world.

                    <h3>King Cobra</h3>
                    <p>
                            Cobras have a reputation for deadliness, and for good reason. 
                            They are typically found in the jungles of India and China. 
                            They are recognizable by their wide hoods, and are able to spit 
                            their toxins. The toxin is immensely painful, and once it enters 
                            the blood stream, it can cause death within a very short time. 
                            Seven ml of venom from this animal is enough to kill an elephant—or 
                            twenty human beings.

                    <h3>Box Jellyfish</h3>
                    <p>
                            This jellyfish is widely regarded as the most poisonous animal 
                            in the world. It floats in the waters surrounding Asia and Australia, 
                            and is so transparent that it is nearly invisible if you are not 
                            looking for it. The tentacles of the box jellyfish produce nematocysts. 
                            Once the toxin reaches the blood, blood pressure increases. This can 
                            lead to a heart attack, and ultimately death. If stung by one of 
                            these jellyfish, do not apply ice or heat. If you have some vinegar, 
                            try soaking the wound site for half an hour while you drive to the 
                            nearest hospital for aid.
